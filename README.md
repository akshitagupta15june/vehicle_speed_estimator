# Real Time Vehicle Detection, Tracking, and Speed Estimation

## Problem - Smart Movement tracking solution of People/Vehicles from Point A to point B üöóüèÉ‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è

### Solution- 

1) The smart system which can help in tracking of people, vehicles travelling from Point A to Point B. 

2) The solution encompass a mechanism by which law enforcement agencies can track if there is a deviation from a specific route, 
   the speed of the vehicles can also be detected.

3) This solution will ensure that vehicles do not cross a speed limit, so as to minimize accidents with animals, who cross the road, especially during monsoon.

### ADVANTAGES

1) The smart system which can help in tracking of people, vehicles travelling from Point A to Point B.

2) The solution encompass a mechanism by which law enforcement agencies can track if there is a deviation from a specific route, the speed of the vehicles can also    be detected.

3) This solution will ensure that vehicles do not cross a speed limit, so as to minimize accidents with animals, who cross the road, especially during monsoon.

4) For nighttime use , we may need infrared cameras and infrared lights and/or adjustments to our camera parameters.
